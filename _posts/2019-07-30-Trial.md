What will my personal website look like?

## Everything starts with why.....or does it? 
-----

It is awkward to start or initiate something new. Like what I am doing right now. 

Making a personal website is never something on my to-do list. It's not because I don't want to do it, somehow I just never really feel the need to start this. 

This perfectly describes how I feel about most things in life.
